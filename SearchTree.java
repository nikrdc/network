  // Does a search tree algorithm that finds the best possible move based on the board and the number of searchDepth

  // Parameters:
  //    board: the current board minimax is analyzing
  //    searchDepth: the number of recursions of minimax
  //    color: the player that is currently being minimaxed (either CurrentPlayer or Opponent)
  //    alpha: the score that the  CurrentPlayer knows with certainty it can achieve
  //    beta: the score that the Opponent is the worst score the Opponent is guarateed to attain
  //
  // Return Value:
  //    Returns the Move that is optimal for the CurrentPlayer given the board and the search depth
  //
  // Other methods that rely on this method:
  //    evaluator:
